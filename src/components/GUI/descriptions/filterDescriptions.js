      You can filter the links by adjusting their threshold. Links will only be drawn, if their link weight is larger or equal to the set threshold.
      For example, if the weight of a link is 0.75 and the threshold is set to 0.8, the link will not be drawn. Increasing this value can
      significantly enhance performance by reducing the graph size.
