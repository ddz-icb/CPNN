      You can filter the links by adjusting their threshold. Links will only be drawn, if their link weight is larger or equal to the set threshold.
      For example, if the weight of a link is 0.75 and the threshold is set to 0.8, the link will not be drawn. Increasing this value can
      significantly enhance performance by reducing the graph size.

    <p>
      Nodes with the same UniprotID and Name will be merged into a single node, along with their respective links. When multiple links to the same
      node are merged, the maximum absolute weight is used as the new link weight. Enabling this setting can significantly enhance performance by
      reducing the graph size.

  <div>
    <p className="margin-0">
      You can filter the components/clusters by setting a minimum size. If a given component is smaller than the applied threshold, the whole

export const minKCoreSizeDescription = (
  <div>
    <p className="margin-0">
      You can filter the graph by removing nodes with too few connections. The threshold defines the minimum number of neighbors a node must have to
      stay in the graph. Nodes below this value are removed step by step until only well-connected nodes remain. Increasing this value can
      significantly enhance performance by reducing the graph size.

export const compDensityDescription = (
  <div>

      You can filter the components/clusters based on their density. The density is measured as the average amount of neighbors per node. If a given
      component has a smaller density than the applied threshold, the component will not be drawn. Increasing this value can significantly enhance

      You can filter the links by formulating a query. These queries must follow the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), meaning that conditions grouped

      <PopupTextField textInside={"and"} />. To address one (or multiple) attributes, parts of the attribute name can be used (e.g.{" "}
      <PopupTextField textInside={"lean"} /> includes all attributes that contain the word "lean"). If the attribute consists of more than one word,
      quotation marks can be used (e.g. <PopupTextField textInside={'"lean group"'} /> ). To forbid an attribute from occuring the{" "}
      <PopupTextField textInside={"not"} /> operator can be applied. To address multiple attributes simultaneously, you can group them as a set, for
      example: <PopupTextField textInside={"{lean, obese, t2d}"} />. To restrict the number of links, you can use the{" "}
      <PopupTextField textInside={">"} />, <PopupTextField textInside={">="} />, <PopupTextField textInside={"<"} />,{" "}
      <PopupTextField textInside={"<="} /> or <PopupTextField textInside={"="} /> operators (e.g., <PopupTextField textInside={">= 2"} /> filters for
