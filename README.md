Co-Phosphorylation Network Navigator (CPNN): Web Application for Interactive Visualization of Co-phosphorylation Networks

## Abstract
As part of diabetes research at the German Diabetes Center, samples from diabetes patients as well as corresponding mouse models and cell experiments are studied to investigate diabetes and insulin resistance. In the context of diabetes research, the phosphoproteome is of particular interest because insulin triggers a complex and not yet fully understood signal transduction cascade with pleiotropic effects, which is mediated by the successive phosphorylation of certain proteins at specific phosphorylation sites. Using the mass spectrometry-based technology of phosphoproteomics, the phosphoproteome of the samples is identified and quantified at the DDZ. The profiles of the quantified phosphopeptides obtained from several samples can then be compared with each other and between groups of samples (e.g. healthy vs. diseased). For this purpose, so-called graphical co-phosphorylation networks can be generated by connecting relatively strongly correlated profiles of two phosphopeptides (nodes) with an edge that represents a co-phosphorylation or other interaction between them. In particular, correlation components of interactions between the phosphopeptides (so-called modules, which can represent signaling pathways) are investigated.
